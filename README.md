# NetMD MD Data Dumper

This software allows you to use any supported NetMD portable to extract the multi-channel audio from MD Data discs recorded by machines such as the Yamaha MD8 and MD4.

It temporarily alters the NetMD portable's firmware in order to supress checks for differences between MD Data and normal MDs.

## How to use?

In order to download the audio data from the MD Data disc onto the PC, you need to:

- Plug in the NetMD portable, with any audio disc inserted (or, if possible, without any disc, but some portables refuse to connect then)
- When prompted by the app, exchange the disc with an MD Data one, then press the appropriate button
- A list of tracks should appear, similar to the one in Web Minidisc Pro - select the tracks you wish to download, then press the button at the bottom of the page.

To switch discs, you do not need to go through the whole connection process again. Simply swap the MD Data disc to a different one, then press the refresh button above the list.

This application is also compatible with normal Audio MDs, so you can download ATRAC audio from them as well.

## What devices are supported?

All devices from [this list](https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sorting/webmd), which support Type-S exploits (recommended), or Type-R exploits (they work, but are very slow), are supported by this application.
